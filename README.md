### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Gdansk with 6 years of experience in the IT industry. My focus area for the past year has been front-end development. I am very quality-conscious because I spent my early career years in QA roles. 

Looking for a company to grow up as a Frontend developer.
